## Intro to Rust concurrencies
Rust concurrency is the ability for applications written in the Rust programming language to execute multiple operations or tasks simultaneously. Concurrency in Rust is achieved by using the Rust language's built-in features such as threads, channels, and synchronization primitives. Threads allow for multiple tasks to be running in parallel, while channels allow for communication between tasks. Finally, synchronization primitives provide a way to ensure that concurrent operations are executed in a safe and orderly fashion.

For example, imagine an application that needs to fetch data from a remote server and then process it. Using Rust concurrency, one thread could be used to fetch the data while a second thread could process the data. The two threads can communicate via a channel, so that when the data is fetched, it can be passed to the processing thread. With the help of synchronization primitives, the two threads can work together safely and in an orderly fashion.

## A Two-thread concurrency example

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Create a channel for communication between threads
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    // Spawn a thread to fetch data from a remote server
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let data = fetch_data();
        // Send the data to the main thread
        tx.send(data).unwrap();
    });

    // Spawn a thread to process the fetched data
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let data = rx.recv().unwrap();
        let processed_data = process_data(data);
        println!("Processed data: {:?}", processed_data);
    });
}

fn fetch_data() -> Vec<i32> {
    // Fetch data from remote server
    vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}

fn process_data(data: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // Process the data
    data.iter().map(|x| x * x).collect()
}
    ```
